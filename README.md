# EmailAgent
My final task in Epam Android Lab 2017.

This program is an implementation on Email Client based on Gmail API.

Here, there are a few screenshots of it:

When I developed design of this application, I read Google recomendations,
that stored on https://material.io/, and tried to follow basic principles of
material design described on this website, using their recomendations about
padding, colors etc.

Also I have used such elements of Material Design Library as:

Android meterial pallete and icons,

RecyclerView,

CardView,

DrawerLayout,

NavigationView,

Toolbar,

Floating action button,

WebView,

Snackbar and other.


A few words about applciation:

This Email client has 5 types of mailboxes: Unread, Inbox, Outbox, Drafts and Trash, where
you can find email letters, stored on your Gmail mailbox. When you want to see the content
of concrete email letter - just tap on it and you will see it's content in seperate window. 
If you want to write a new letter to your friend, the only thing you need is to tap on 
Floating action button and to fill fields in opened window. There, you can also attach files
or images if you want.
