# EmailAgent
My final task in Epam Android Lab 2017.

This program is an implementation on Email Client based on Gmail API.

Here, there are a few screenshots of it:

When I developed design of this application, I read Google recomendations,
that stored on https://material.io/, and tried to follow basic principles of
material design described on this website, using their recomendations about
padding, colors etc.

Also I have used such elements of Material Design Library as:

Android meterial pallete and icons
RecyclerView
CardView
DrawerLayout
Floating action button 
WebView 
Snackbar and other.
